A house with a tiny blue door
It is a quiet and discreet place just 12 km from Tel Aviv, in the beautiful city of Hertzeliya. A space to work, create, produce and relax. Soundrounded by a patio and garden. The Neve Amal neighborhood is one of the few residential sites in Herzeliya where there are still houses with courtyards, making it a peaceful community with trees and gardens. We are just 1km from the center of Hertzeliya and 7km from the beach and Apolonia National Park.
